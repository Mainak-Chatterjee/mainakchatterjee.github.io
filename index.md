I am Rachit Bansal, an undergraduate student at Delhi Technological University. I am broadly interested in the areas of interpretability and robustness for natural language processing.

Over the past few years, I walked my first baby steps as a researcher owing to some wonderful people and collaborations. Most recently, I was a research intern at Adobe India, where I worked on commonsense reasoning for large language models. Before that, I collaborated with [Danish](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ddanish/]) for an year to understand and evaluate model explanations for NLP. I also spent a wonderful summer working on devising machine translation techniques for extremely low-resource languages as a part of the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative ([CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu/)), University of Oxford, advised by [Dr. Jacob Dahl](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/person/jacob-dahl) and [Dr. Niko Schenk](https://www.english-linguistics.de/nschenk/). My first exposure to research was at [LCS2, IIIT-D](https://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in), where I was advised by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/).
