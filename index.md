I am Rachit Bansal, an undergraduate student at Delhi Technological University. I am broadly interested in the areas of interpretability and robustness in NLP.  

<!-- Previously, I was a __research scientist__ at [Yandex Research]({{site.yandex_research_main}}) and worked closely with the [Yandex Translate](https://translate.yandex.com) team<a onMouseOver="document.fox.src='/img/people/foxie.jpeg';" onMouseOut="document.fox.src='/img/people/lena-min.png';">.</a>
I (still) [teach NLP](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course) at the [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://yandexdataschool.com). -->

During the past few years, I have been fortunate to work with some amazing people. Currently, I am a research intern at Adobe India. Most recently, I collaborated with [Danish](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ddanish/]) on evaluating attribution methods for NLP. Before that, I spent an year working at [LCS2, IIIT-D](https://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in), advised by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/). I also spent a wonderful summer working on extremely low-resource MT as a part of the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative ([CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu/)), University of Oxford, where I was advised by [Dr. Jacob Dahl](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/person/jacob-dahl) and [Dr. Niko Schenk](https://www.english-linguistics.de/nschenk/).
