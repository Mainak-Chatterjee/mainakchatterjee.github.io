I am Rachit Bansal, an undergraduate student at Delhi Technological University. I am broadly interested in the areas of interpretability and robustness for natural language processing.

Over the past few years, I have had the great fortune to be involved in some didactic collaborations. Currently, I am a research intern at Adobe India working on commonsense reasoning for large language models. Most recently, I collaborated with [Danish](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ddanish/]) on evaluating attribution methods for NLP. Before that, I spent an year working at [LCS2, IIIT-D](https://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in), advised by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/). I also spent a wonderful summer working on extremely low-resource MT as a part of the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative ([CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu/)), University of Oxford, where I was advised by [Dr. Jacob Dahl](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/person/jacob-dahl) and [Dr. Niko Schenk](https://www.english-linguistics.de/nschenk/).
