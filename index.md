I am Rachit Bansal, a pre-doctoral researcher at Google Research India. I am broadly interested in making language models useful, controllable, and accessible. I am also interested in interpretability and analysis. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the Delhi Technological University.

Over the past few years, I walked my first baby steps as a researcher owing to some wonderful people and collaborations. I pursued my bachelor's thesis research with [Prof. Yonatan Belinkov](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~belinkov/) at the Technion in Israel. There I had a great time studying how [intrinsic properties of a neural network](https://rachitbansal.github.io/information-measures) are informative of generalization behaviours. Before that, I was a research intern at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/)'s Media and Data Science Research Lab, where I worked on [commonsense reasoning for large language models](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.83/).

I am extremely fortunate to have been involved in some incredible collaborations. I worked with [Danish](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ddanish/) for more than two years to [evaluate explanation methods](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00465/110436/Evaluating-Explanations-How-Much-Do-Explanations) in NLP[^1]. I also worked for more than two years with [Naomi](https://nsaphra.net/) on studying [mode connectivity in loss surfaces](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hY6M0JHl3uL) of language models[^2].

I also spent a couple of wonderful summers as a part of the Google Summer of Code program with the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative ([CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu/)). Here, I was advised by [Prof. Jacob Dahl](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/person/jacob-dahl) and [Dr. Niko Schenk](https://www.english-linguistics.de/nschenk/). My first exposure to research was at [LCS2, IIIT-D](https://www.lcs2.in/).
