I am Mainak, a graduate from [Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Technology (MAKAUT), West Bengal](https://makautwb.ac.in/) from where I have completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication. Currently I am working as a Junior Project Engineer at the prestigious [Complex Network Research Group (CNeRG) Lab](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/), Department of Computer Science Engineering, [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. Saptarshi Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/saptarshighosh/) where I am working on applying various Large Language Models (LLMs) and Encoder-Decoder based Models on various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Cross-lingual Summarization, Machine Translation and Question-Answering specifically focusing on the Legal Domain. Broadly, I am interested in making Language Models useful, robust and grounded. I am also interested in understanding and analysis.

Prior to this, I was a Research Intern at the Futuristic Wireless and Network Technologies Group, G.S. Sanyal School of Telecommunications, [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), where I worked with [Prof. Debarati Sen](https://sites.google.com/view/debarati-sen) on designing modern digital communication systems with the help of Neural Networks. My project focused on improving the performance of various communication receivers, exploring efficient fine-tuning techniques to enhance them, and developing an effective communication system implemented by the usage of Neural Networks.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Cross-lingual Summarization, Grounding of LLMs.

In the past, I interned at the [IIT (ISM) Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/) under [Prof. Samrat Mukhopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/view/samratspace/home?authuser=0), focusing on implementation and testing on Generalized Online Caching Algorithms. At [Suvidha Foundation](https://suvidhafoundationedutech.org/), I developed a flower classification model using CNNs and ML Classification Models to classify various types of flower models captured by the camera of mobile devices.
